# StarDom
# A web-based space game

[Design | Develop | Test ] RELEASE

Check out a quick intro at www.cutenesss.xyz

The main concepts:
A game where you and 4 other friends can team up to fight other squads, in a week long battle featuring large fleets carefully manuvering around each other.

So far I have accomplised:
Point system
User account/Authentication

General infomation: 
3-5 Day long games
Point system
Ship System
Planatary system
4 Classes of ships:
- Command ships (each player is given one of these at the start of every game)
  - They are very slow, They have low offense, however has high defense. Its HP is also very high. It might offer a proximity bonus later in development. 
- Fighter ships (each player will start of with 4)
  - The fighter ships are very fast, have medium attack and very low defense. Their HP is also very low. 
- TBA
- TBA
  
**The fighter ships can take down a command ship on a ratio around 1 command ship : 2 fighter ships**

The map will be eventually hexagonal, but will be square during the very early steps of development. 
The backend will be C#, and the front end will consist of HTML, CSS, Razor and Javascript.
